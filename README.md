# genshin-checkin-helper

More than check-in for Genshin Impact.

This fork is a **lazy attempt** at using [thesadru/genshin.py](https://github.com/thesadru/genshin.py) library on re-used codes from [y1ndan/genshin-checkin-helper](https://gitlab.com/y1ndan/genshin-checkin-helper).

Does not have support for CN-version of the games (there are much better projects out there).

## Disclaimer

I'm not a frequent Python programmer, so brace yourself for various imperfect or straight-up-weird coding standards.

The reason why I decided to fork y1ndan/genshin-checkin-helper instead of writing my own from scratch is mainly due to my lack of experience with Python. Otherwise it would have been better to write something that revolved around genshin.py library itself, instead of having genshin.py as an "alternative" as it is now.
