# genshin-checkin-helper

More than check-in for Genshin Impact.

Upstream: [https://gitlab.com/y1ndan/genshin-checkin-helper](https://gitlab.com/y1ndan/genshin-checkin-helper)

This fork is a lazy attempt at integrating the upstream project with [thesadru/genshin.py](https://github.com/thesadru/genshin.py) library.
Said library has better support for Global/HoYoLAB APIs (such as Real-Times Notes), while the upstream project uses a library that was mainly intended for Chinese/BBS APIs (though it does have partial support for Global/HoYoLAB APIs, but not Real-Time Notes).
